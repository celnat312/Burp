# Term-1-CTD-Project
SUTD's Term 1 Python-only CTD Project

The prompt given was to "write a software/game to solve an interesting problem" using only python. 

As a group, we have decided to create a recipe-finding and sharing software to provide a platform to young adults
or individuals who just started living independently meal ideas that they can make. We chose this problem because 
we feel that oftentimes when we start living alone, we get overwhelmed by "what should I eat" and "do I have the ingredients?".

Thus, to address this problem, we decided to create a recipe-finding and sharing software to make a Better World By Design.

Furthermore, in this repository, we will be breaking down the different functions into the respective .py files:
- burp_final.py --> main functions of the software (FE codes linked to BE)
- database.py --> Initialises the class Table and its respective child classes with their methods
- BE.py --> all BE functions 

Reminder insert your own API_KEY and SEARCH_ENGINE_ID in "credential" folder
