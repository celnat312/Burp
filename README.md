# Term-1-CTD-Project
SUTD's Term 1 Python-only CTD Project

The prompt given was to "write a software/game to solve an interesting problem" using only python. 

As a group, we have decided to create a recipe-finding and sharing software to provide a platform to young adults
or individuals who just started living independently meal ideas that they can make. We chose this problem because 
we feel that oftentimes when we start living alone, we get overwhelmed by "what should I eat" and "do I have the ingredients?".

Thus, to address this problem, we decided to create a recipe-finding and sharing software to make a Better World By Design.

Furthermore, in this repository, we will be breaking down the different functions into the respective .py files:
- main.py --> main functions
- database.py --> initialising database
- login.py --> login functions
- PullingFromNet.py --> functions relating to pulling recipes, images, url and other information from the internet
- Interface.py --> functions relating to the interface of the program

If you have any queries regarding this project, feel free to contact any one of the contributors for further information!
